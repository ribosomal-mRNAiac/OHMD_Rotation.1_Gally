# Rotation_1_Gally.OmpA: Phylogenetic analysis of the Outer Membrane Protein A of E.coli and accompanying analyses.
This work was completed as part of my first rotation project in the Gally Lab Group under the Wellcome Trust One Health Models of Disease PhD programme.

## In this repository are:
* The R script written to take BLAST outputs, format 6 TSVs, and translate the OmpA genomic sequences into amino acid sequences.
* The R script used to generate figures for my deliverables.
* The data used to generate figures.
* The data used to visualise phylogenetic trees in iTOL.
* Image files of the majority of figures used in my deliverables.

## Acknowledgements:
I would like to thank all of the members of the Gally Lab for their help with my project. In particular I would like to thank Annita Chalka and Talal Hossein for their advice and help with regard to the computational analyses, as well as Professor David Gally for suggesting the project idea and Dr Alison Low, for designing the experiments and giving a guiding hand throughout.
